Title: Bike Find

Description: 

Bike Find is a full functional web application which is very near and dear to my heart. I have always loved bicycling. I have ridden bikes all my life as a means of transportation. It was only after I came to the US, I discovered mountain biking and trail riding. Riding a bikes was a lifestyle and not an adventure that it is now. 

It is a very user-friendly application where users can search and buy their dream mountain bikes. I developed this web app keeping in mind the functionalities that are imperative in a e-commerce website, but also keeping it really simple and easy for users to navigate through the app. A GPS is only as effective, if it directs one from point A to point B correctly and as conveniently as possible.

For a user to transact via this app, he/she has to signup and be logged in. The signup process is quite short and simple, where it only asks for your email, first and last name, and matching password of your choosing. Once you login with your user details, you are directed to a landing page, the homepage. You can access a list of inventories by simply clicking on Inventory on the navigation tab at the top. This page displays all the product details and a Buy button. If you hit buy, it will take you to your cart where it will display your cart details. In order to complete your purchase, you can simply hit checkout and the app will execute your transaction.

A user is only limited to these few features, where as an admin has access to more features such as editing, deleting and creating a new product to the inventory list.
